# Long Read Assembly Pipelines
### USE AT YOUR OWN RISK

This directory contains code to generate de novo assemblies from long-read sequencing data (optionally polished with short-read Illumina data). Bash scripts have been created based on data structure at IGS servers. 

To generate assemblies,
1) Generate assemlby with raw Pacbio 
2) Polish iterveily with Quiver (we do two rounds)
3) Polish with Illumina data using Pilon
